## Description

Semester Project 1 was the first big project I completed in my first year of the front-end study program. The brief was to create a website for the community science museum, which was targeted primarily at children (7-15 years old) and families with young children. The website was to be informative, engaging and appealing to its target audience, without being pandering. The website consists of 5 pages:
- A home page containing a description of the museum and information on what it offers for kids, teachers and researchers.
- An exhibits page showing special events and regular exhibit spaces.
- An event page dynamically built based on which event the user selected on the exhibits page. The page details the event and encourages the user to view the visit page for information on how to visit the museum.
- A visit page detailing information about the location of the museum, open hours, admission, accessibility of the museum, shops and clubs.
- A contact page containing a contact form and information about how to get involved with the museum.

## Built With
This project was created using HTML and CSS.

## Getting Started

## Contributing
If you wish to contribute by sending in feedback, you are welcome to do so. I am relatively new to front-end development, and I am sure there are many improvements to be made. You are also able to submit code to the project, since the project is uploaded on a public GitHub repository. If you want to do so, be sure to open a pull request so the code can be reviewed.
